Quickshot
=========

Lightweight screenshot application for Windows written in C#.

## Downloads
To download the application visit the [release] section of the repository.

## Usage
- Simply download your preferred [release] and run the accompanying program.
- When you want to take a screenshot press `Print Screen` on your keyboard, the screen will pause giving you time to draw the capture region.
  - You're actually looking at a screenshot of the screen from when you pressed `Print Screen`
- As soon as you release the left mouse button the image is uploaded to Imgur
- A popup will appear with a single button allowing you to copy the URL to your clipboard.

## Licensing
I'm perfectly happy for people to use the source code from this project provided that they use it within the bounds of the provided [license].

## I found a bug!
Please post it on the [issue] tracker if you haven't already, it's the easiest way for me to keep up to date on any flaws in the program.

### Note
Whilst this project is actually designed as a learning resource for [Skkype](http://github.com/Skkype) it actually works extremely efficiently as a drop-in replacement for tools such as Gyazo and Lightshot, you can download it from the [release] section of the repository.
